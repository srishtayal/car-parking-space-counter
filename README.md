# ðŸš— Car Parking Space Detection using OpenCV

This project is a simple Computer Vision application that automatically detects free and occupied parking spaces in a parking lot using video footage. It's built with Python, OpenCV, and CVZone â€” and runs entirely on **Google Colab**, making it super easy to use without worrying about local dependencies.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- ðŸ“· Detects empty vs occupied parking spaces in real-time from video
- ðŸ§  Smart adaptive thresholding with optional trackbars
- ðŸ’» Fully functional on Google Colab (no local install needed)
- ðŸ’¾ Save and load parking positions using pickle

---

## ðŸš€ How to Run on Colab

1. Open the notebook: **`ParkingCounter.ipynb`**
2. Upload:
   - `carPark.mp4`
   - `carParkImg.png`
   - `CarParkPos` (after marking spaces)
3. Run all cells and watch the parking detection magic happen 

>  Use `ParkingSpacePicker.py` locally to manually mark parking areas and generate `CarParkPos`.
